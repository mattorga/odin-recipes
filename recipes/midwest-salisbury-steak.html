  <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
  <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
  <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
  <li>1/2 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

<h3>Gravy:</h3>

  <li>2 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
  <li>1 sweet onion, sliced</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1/2 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups beef stock</li>
  <li>1 cup water</li>
  <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Gather the ingredients. </li>
  <li>Make the patties: Mix ground sirloin, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk, 1/2 packet onion soup mix, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large bowl; shape into 5 patties.</li>
  <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot skillet until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
  <li>Make the gravy: Melt butter in a separate skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir flour and remaining 1/2 packet onion soup mix into mushroom mixture until combined.</li>
  <li>Gradually add beef stock and water, stirring continually, until simmering. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring frequently, until gravy has thickened, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>Place browned patties into gravy; simmer until very tender, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
